// ou can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.

// i++;

// is the equivalent of

// i = i + 1;

// Note
// The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

var myVar = 87;

myVar++;

// Decrement a Number with JavaScript
// You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the -- operator.

// i--;

// is the equivalent of

// i = i - 1;

// Note
// The entire line becomes i--;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

var myVar = 11;

myVar--;

// remainder % (0,1 = even, odd)
var remainder = 11 % 3;


// Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition
// In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:

// myVar = myVar + 5;

// to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

// One such operator is the += operator.
// var myVar = 1;
// myVar += 5;
// console.log(myVar); // Returns 6

a += 12;
b += 9
c += 7;

// Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction
// Like the += operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable.

// myVar = myVar - 5;

// will subtract 5 from myVar. This can be rewritten as:

// myVar -= 5;

// Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator.

var a = 11;
var b = 9;
var c = 3;

// Only change code below this line
a -= 6;
b -= 15;
c -= 1;
